# üìäüí≠ WorkWell: Data-Driven Mental Health Insights for Tech Professionals

## üéØ Project Overview
Mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, and burnout are increasingly common among tech professionals due to long working hours, high pressure, and remote/hybrid work culture. Despite this, many employees hesitate to seek support due to stigma, lack of awareness, or fear of discrimination.

**WorkWell** leverages survey data (2018‚Äì2023) to **analyze workplace mental health trends** and build **predictive models** to help organizations identify risk factors and understand employee comfort levels in discussing mental health at work.

## üìä Dataset

**Source:** [OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://osmhhelp.org/research.html)  

**Overview:**  
The dataset consists of survey responses from tech professionals between **2018 and 2023**, capturing workplace mental health trends, perceptions, and policies. It focuses on factors affecting **stress, anxiety, burnout, and willingness to discuss mental health at work**.

**Key Features Include:**  
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, race, country, company size, role type.  
- **Workplace Factors:** Employer mental health benefits, formal discussions, awareness campaigns, leave policies, anonymity.  
- **Perceptions & Comfort:** Employee comfort discussing mental health with coworkers and supervisors, stigma perceptions, importance of mental vs. physical health.  
- **Experience:** Prior disclosures, family history of mental illness, prior employer support.

**Notes:**  
- Some responses contain `Unknown` or missing values, which were handled during preprocessing.  
- The dataset is primarily used for **EDA and predictive modeling** to identify risk factors and forecast comfort in disclosing mental health issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objectives
1. **Analyze survey trends** in workplace mental health over 5 years.
2. **Identify risk factors** such as lack of benefits, low openness, or absence of formal discussions.
3. **Predict employee comfort** in discussing mental health with coworkers and supervisors.
4. **Provide actionable insights** embedded within visualizations.

## üìà Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (`NaN`, `Unknown`) and standardize categorical variables (`Yes/No`, `True/False`).
- Encode demographics (age, gender, race, employer size).
- Convert target variables for ML models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, race, employer size distributions.
- **Employer Policies & Resources:** Mental health benefits, formal discussions, awareness trends.
- **Comfort & Stigma:** Comfort levels with coworkers and supervisors.
- **Historical Trends:** Changes from 2018‚Äì2023.
- **Statistical Relationships:** Gender, age, employer size vs. willingness to disclose mental health issues.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Relationship between demographics, employer policies, and willingness to disclose.

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Observations and actionable insights are **directly included below each visualization**.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Approach

### Target Variables
- **Comfort with Coworkers:** Would an employee feel comfortable discussing mental health issues with coworkers?  
- **Comfort with Supervisors:** Would an employee feel comfortable discussing mental health issues with supervisors?

| **Random Forest**       | 0.64     | 0.71              | 0.67           | 0.68             | High recall for *Maybe*; perfect *Unknown* detection.                              | Weak recall for *Yes*; many *Yes ‚Üí Maybe* misclassifications.              |
| **XGBoost**             | 0.63     | 0.67              | 0.67           | 0.67             | Balanced performance across classes; strong *Unknown* detection.                   | Lower accuracy than Random Forest & CatBoost; struggles with *Yes* recall. |

| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logistic Regression** | ~58%     | Simple, interpretable baseline model.                                  | Struggles with complex, non-linear relationships.                                     | Useful as a benchmark but not sufficient for nuanced predictions.      |
| **Random Forest**       | ~61%     | Handles non-linearity well, robust against overfitting.               | Moderate accuracy, tends to confuse ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.                                | Performed better than Logistic Regression but limited generalization.  |
| **XGBoost**             | ~60%     | Strong gradient boosting algorithm, effective for structured data.    | Accuracy not significantly better than Random Forest; ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù class misclassified often. | Stable performance, but tuning is critical for improvements.           |
| **CatBoost**            | **65%**  | Best accuracy among tested models; handles categorical data efficiently. | ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù class still weak; longer training time.                                       | Most reliable so far, especially strong in classifying ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. |
